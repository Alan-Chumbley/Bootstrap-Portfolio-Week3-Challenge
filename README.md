# Bootstrap-Portfolio-Week3-Challenge
Week 3 Challenge 
In this weeks challenge we had to create a proftofolio using bootstrap to show us the effeciencies of the platform. 

If I had more time I would definitley fiddle with the colours in css. 


Here is what the client side looks like with CTA's at the forefront of the jumbotron.

Here is a snapshot of the main content and links to external sites opening up in new tabs.

lastly, I made a footer that I am yet to link up with the rest of the site.
